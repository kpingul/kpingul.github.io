                What is Threat Modeling?

            </p>
            <p>
                Threat modeling is a structured approach used in security to help organizations understand potential threats to their systems and how they can best protect their assets. The process usually involves identifying assets, defining the system's attack surface, establishing trust boundaries, and enumerating threats. Ultimately, this helps teams keep track of all potential security risks to its software applications. This record then guides the teams in making well-thought-out decisions to deal with these risks.

                The Four Questions of Threat Modeling

            </p>
            <p>
                Adam Shostack, a renowned expert in the field, simplified threat modeling into four fundamental questions:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. <b>What are we building?</b> This involves a deep understanding of the system being developed or maintained, including its purpose, functionality, and components.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. <b>What can go wrong?</b> Here, teams brainstorm potential threats and vulnerabilities that could negatively impact the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. <b>What are we going to do about it? </b> After identifying threats, teams develop mitigation strategies to protect their systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. <b>Did we do a good job?  </b> This question prompts a review of the threat model and the proposed solutions. It's an opportunity to learn and improve for future iterations.

            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px">
                I found these four questions easy to remember to form the basis for any threat modeling I perform. It provides a simple framework that can be adapted to suit different organizations and systems.

            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #4b4b4b !important; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold;" >
                <b>Identifying Assets</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step in threat modeling is usually identifying what needs to be protected. Assets can be anything of value to an organization, such as customer data, intellectual property, or physical equipment. Once the assets have been identified, teams can better understand what is at stake and prioritize their security efforts accordingly.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #4b4b4b !important; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold;" >
                <b>Defining the Attack Surface</b> 
            </p>
            <p>
                The attack surface is the sum of all potential points where an unauthorized user can attempt to enter data to or extract data from an environment. These could be user interfaces, network interfaces, or APIs. Understanding the attack surface allows teams to identify where threats are most likely to occur and where protective measures should be focused.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #4b4b4b !important; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold;" >
                <b>Establishing Trust Boundaries</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Trust boundaries delineate areas of different levels of trust within a system. These can be physical boundaries, such as between a device and the network, or logical boundaries, such as between different layers of an application. Trust boundaries are crucial for controlling access and protecting sensitive information within a system.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #4b4b4b !important; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold;" >
                <b>Enumerating Threats Using the STRIDE Model</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we come to the enumeration of threats. One popular approach for this is the STRIDE model, which stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. Each term refers to a type of threat that could be posed to a system. By considering each category in turn, teams can ensure they have a comprehensive view of the potential threats to their system.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #4b4b4b !important; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold;" >
                <b>The Benefits of Threat Modeling</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Threat modeling provides a number of benefits to teams. It encourages proactive thinking about security, allowing potential issues to be addressed before they become problems. This can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and the associated costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, by understanding the threats to a system, teams can prioritize their efforts, focusing on the areas that pose the greatest risk. This makes the process of securing a system more efficient and effective.
            </p>

                Conclusion
            </p>
            <p>
                Threat modeling is an essential part of any security strategy. By asking the right questions, identifying assets, understanding the attack surface, establishing trust boundaries, and enumerating threats, teams can protect their systems and their assets from the ever-evolving threats in the world of cybersecurity.
