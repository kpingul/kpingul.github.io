            </p>
            <p>
                AppSecCon kicked off with an opening keynote that turned the spotlight on the importance of software security at the board level. The sessions that followed were a mix of everything from AppSec 101, the role of AI in AppSec, to decoding industry buzzwords like ASOC, ASPM, RBVM, and UVM.
            </p>
            <p>
                The conference touched on issues like supply chain security and DevSecOps best practices, and even future-facing topics like building a resilient AppSec program. Management-oriented sessions got down to AppSec governance and making a business case for AppSec, with a nod to the role of automation in bridging talent gaps.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second day put the focus on the journey to AppSec maturity, with discussions on topics such as CISO priorities in software security, the state of AppSecOps in 2023, and the attributes of a modern AppSec maturity model.
