            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                I'm writing to share my first time experience at NahamCon 2023, a virtual offensive security conference I recently got to attend.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b4b4b !important; font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: bold;" >What is the NahamCon?</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.nahamcon.com/" target="_blank" style="display: inline; font-size: 1.1rem">NahamCon,</a>founded by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nahamsec" style="display: inline; font-size: 1.1rem">@NahamSec</a>is an event that brings together a diverse group of security professionals, hackers, and enthusiasts. NahamSec is a popular hacker, content creator, trainer, public speaker, and prior to becoming a content creator, he was the head of Hacker Education at HackerOne. His hacking career consisted of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities for major companies such as Yahoo, Google, Airbnb, Snapchat, and the US Department of Defense. He also co-founded the Bug Bounty Forum and is passionate about helping others break into the field of ethical hacking​.

                The conference was hosted by @_johnhammond, @ippsec, and @Alh4zr3d. They did a great job in keeping things live and engaging throughout the day​. The conference covered a bunch of topics, like strategies for effective bug bounty programs, insights into leaked secrets, building automated attack surface recon, how to own APIs for valid submissions, and a ton more. The session that really blew me away was about hacking root EPP servers to take control of zones. And at the end, there was a fascinating discussion about how GPT-based AI will disrupt security. It was like getting a sneak peek into the future of what's to come.

            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, NahamCon was a fun experience, packed with enlightening sessions that highlighted the importance and ever-evolving nature of offensive security. The hosts and speakers/presenters did an amazing job. If you're an aspiring hacker or somebody who wants to pivot into OffSec, I'd highly recommend tuning in next year.
